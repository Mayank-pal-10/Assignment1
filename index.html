    <p><strong>[Intro]</strong></p>
    <p>Ooh, girl, you're shining</p>
    <p>Like a Fifth Avenue diamond</p>
    <p>And they don't make you like they used to</p>
    <p>You're never going out of style</p>

    <p><strong>[Verse 1]</strong></p>
    <p>Ooh, pretty baby</p>
    <p>This world might've gone crazy</p>
    <p>The way you saved me, who could blame me</p>
    <p>When I just wanna make you smile?</p>

    <p><strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong></p>
    <p>I wanna thrill you like Michael</p>
    <p>I wanna kiss you like Prince</p>
    <p>Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway</p>
    <p>Write a song for you like this</p>

    <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong></p>
    <p>You're over my head, I'm out of my mind</p>
    <p>Thinking I was born in the wrong time</p>
    <p>One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic</p>
    <p>Baby, you're so classic</p>
    <p>Yeah, yeah, so classic</p>
    <p>Baby, you're so classic</p>

    <p><strong>[Verse 2]</strong></p>
    <p>Four dozen roses, anything for you to notice</p>
    <p>All the way to serenade you, doing it Sinatra style</p>
    <p>I'ma pick you up in a Cadillac like a gentleman bringing glamour back</p>
    <p>Keep it real to real in the way I feel, I could walk you down the aisle</p>

    <p><strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong></p>
    <p>I wanna do you like Michael</p>
    <p>I wanna kiss you like Prince</p>
    <p>Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway</p>
    <p>Write a song for you like this</p>

    <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong></p>
    <p>You're over my head, I'm out of my mind</p>
    <p>Thinking I was born in the wrong time</p>
    <p>It's love on rewind, everything is so throwback-ish</p>
    <p>I kinda like it how ya—</p>
    <p>Out of my league, old school chic</p>
    <p>Like a movie star from a silver screen</p>
    <p>You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic</p>
    <p>Baby, you're so classic</p>
    <p>Hey! Hey!</p>
    <p>Baby, you're so classic</p>

    <p><strong>[Verse 3]</strong></p>
    <p>Baby, you're class and baby, you're sick</p>
    <p>I never met a girl like you ever till we met</p>
    <p>A star in the '40s, centerfold in the '50s</p>
    <p>Got me trippin' out like the '60s, hippies</p>
    <p>Queen of the discotheque</p>

    <p>A '70s dream and an '80s best</p>
    <p>Hepburn, Beyoncé, Marilyn, Massive</p>
    <p>Girl, you're timeless, just so classic</p>

    <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong></p>
    <p>You're over my head, I'm out of my mind</p>
    <p>Thinking I was born in the wrong time</p>
    <p>It's love on rewind, everything is so throwback-ish</p>
    <p>I kinda like it how ya—</p>
    <p>Out of my league, old school chic</p>
    <p>Like a movie star from a silver screen</p>
    <p>You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic</p>
    <p>Baby, you're so classic</p>
    <p>Ooh-woah, uh, ooh-woah-oh</p>
    <p>Baby, you're so classic</p>
    <p>Hey yeah</p>
    <p>Baby, you're so classic</p>
